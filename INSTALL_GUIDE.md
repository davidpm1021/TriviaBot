# TriviaBot Installation Guide

## Current Situation
Your TriviaBot is **fully built and configured** with your API keys! The only step remaining is installing Python dependencies.

## ✅ What's Ready
- ✅ Complete bot code with all features
- ✅ API keys securely configured  
- ✅ Professional project structure
- ✅ Database models and AI integration
- ✅ 5 personality types ready to use

## 🔧 Installation Options

### Option 1: Install Dependencies (Recommended)

You'll need to install the Python packages. Choose the method that works for your environment:

#### Method A: System Package Manager
```bash
# Install pip first
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv

# Then install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Method B: Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
# Install venv if needed
sudo apt install python3-venv

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate it
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run bot
python main.py
```

#### Method C: User Installation
```bash
# Install to user directory (no sudo needed)
python3 -m pip install --user -r requirements.txt
```

#### Method D: Manual Package Installation
```bash
# Install packages one by one
python3 -m pip install --user discord.py
python3 -m pip install --user openai
python3 -m pip install --user python-dotenv
python3 -m pip install --user sqlalchemy
python3 -m pip install --user aiofiles
python3 -m pip install --user pydantic
python3 -m pip install --user python-dateutil
```

### Option 2: Alternative Environment

If you can't install packages in the current environment, you can:

1. **Copy the project** to a machine where you have admin access
2. **Use Docker** (if available)
3. **Use a cloud service** like Replit, Railway, or Heroku

## 🚀 Once Dependencies are Installed

```bash
# Test the configuration
python3 test_config.py

# Run the bot
python3 main.py

# In Discord, sync commands (first time only)
!sync

# Start playing!
/trivia
/answer A
/stats
```

## 📋 Required Packages

The bot needs these Python packages:
- `discord.py` - Discord bot framework
- `openai` - AI question generation
- `python-dotenv` - Environment variables
- `sqlalchemy` - Database management
- `aiofiles` - Async file operations
- `pydantic` - Data validation
- `python-dateutil` - Date utilities

## 🆘 Need Help?

If you can't install dependencies:
1. Try the virtual environment approach
2. Use `--user` flag for user-only installation
3. Contact your system administrator
4. Use an alternative environment like Replit

## 🔐 Security Note

Your API keys are safely stored in the `.env` file and will never be exposed in code or version control. The bot follows enterprise security best practices.
