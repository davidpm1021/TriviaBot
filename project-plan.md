Here's a detailed project plan to build your AI-powered, personality-driven, competitive Discord trivia bot:

---

## **Phase 1: Foundation & Setup**

### 1.1 Define Requirements

* Bot language: Python (with Discord.py or nextcord)
* AI backend: OpenAI API (for trivia generation + persona emulation)
* Database: PostgreSQL or SQLite for user data, scores, and settings
* Hosting: Consider Railway, Replit, or a VPS like DigitalOcean

### 1.2 Set Up Your Dev Environment

* GitHub repo for version control
* .env file for API keys and configs
* Set up Discord developer portal & get bot token
* Deploy a basic bot that responds to ping

---

## **Phase 2: Trivia Engine (AI-Generated)**

### 2.1 Prompt Design for AI Trivia

* Build a prompt template:
  "Give me a trivia question in the category of {CATEGORY}, difficulty {LEVEL}, from the time period {TIME\_PERIOD}. Format as: Question | A | B | C | D | Correct Answer"

### 2.2 Command Interface

* `/trivia [category] [difficulty] [era]` → generates a question
* Options default to random if not specified

### 2.3 Answer Handling

* Users DM bot or respond in-thread
* Bot verifies answer, gives instant feedback, and logs stats

---

## **Phase 3: Scoring & Normalization System**

### 3.1 Normalize Scores

* Score = `Base Points × Speed Multiplier`
* Example formula:
  `Score = 100 × (1 + (max(0, 30 - response_time_in_sec) / 30))`
  (Answering in under 30 sec gives bonus)

### 3.2 Track Stats Per User

* Wins, losses, streaks
* Avg. response time
* Categories mastered

---

## **Phase 4: Rounds & Asynchronous Competition**

### 4.1 Game Modes

* **Solo mode**: answer on your own
* **Challenge mode**: bot DMs same question to two+ users; fastest correct wins
* **Daily Battle**: one question per day for all active players

### 4.2 Leaderboard Logic

* Rankings based on:

  * Avg. score per round
  * Win rate
  * Streak bonus

---

## **Phase 5: Personality Engine**

### 5.1 Default Bot Persona

* Over-the-top rude, sarcastic AI (think "Clippy with a bad attitude")
* Use system prompts like:
  "You are a smug, obnoxious trivia host who insults wrong answers and gloats on correct ones."

### 5.2 Persona Swapping

* `/persona [name]` → switch to Einstein, Oprah, Gordon Ramsay, etc.
* AI prompt changes style based on selected persona
* Store persona choice per user or per server

---

## **Phase 6: Memory & Persistence**

### 6.1 User Memory

* Track Discord ID → username, scores, preferred category/persona, recent activity
* Save to DB after each game

### 6.2 Session Awareness

* Bot can resume games after restarts
* Store incomplete rounds with timestamp

---

## **Phase 7: UI & Discord Experience**

### 7.1 Visual Formatting

* Use embeds for trivia questions
* Reactions/buttons for answers (if supported by Discord.js or nextcord)

### 7.2 Channel Behavior

* Designate channels for solo vs. multiplayer
* Optional: Threaded sessions for 1-on-1 challenges

---

## **Phase 8: Testing & Launch**

### 8.1 Internal Testing

* Test game logic, scoring, leaderboard edge cases
* Validate AI outputs for quality and bias

### 8.2 Soft Launch

* Open to friends or small Discord group
* Gather UX feedback

### 8.3 Full Launch

* Enable server-wide or bot invite link
* Monitor usage and server load

---

## **Optional Features**

* Streak rewards / badges
* "Roast me" mode (AI roasts players based on stats)
* Trivia tournaments with brackets
* NFT-style collectible question themes (just aesthetic)

Let me know when you're ready and I'll generate the full repo structure, key files (like `main.py`, `trivia.py`, `score_utils.py`, `personality.py`), and sample prompts. Or I can help you start with a minimal working version and build piece by piece.
